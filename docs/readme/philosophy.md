  (title Philosophy of Fletcher Test Validations)
)
) -->

Fletcher test validations are designed to provide a functional, composable, and expressive approach to test assertions in F#. Unlike traditional assertion libraries that throw exceptions on failure, Fletcher validations return a `TestResult` value. This enables:

- **Composability:** Test results can be combined, piped, and further processed, supporting complex validation flows.
- **Functional Style:** Validations are functions that can be used directly or in pipelines, aligning with idiomatic F# code.
- **Clarity:** Each validation is explicit about what it checks, making tests easy to read and maintain.
- **Extensibility:** Users can define custom validations and compose them with built-in ones.
- **Non-Exception Flow:** By avoiding exceptions for control flow, tests remain predictable and side-effect free.

The philosophy is to empower developers to write robust, maintainable, and expressive tests that fit naturally into functional programming workflows.
